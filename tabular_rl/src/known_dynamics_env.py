'''
Gym (gymnasium) environment for a canonical MDP with known dynamics.
The dynamics is specified by the next state probability distributions 
p(s'/s,a) and a deterministic rewards table r(s,a,s').
Because we assume p(s'/s,a) and r(s,a,s') are the "correct" (represent
the actual world), one can calculate the optimum solution using fast
iterative methods called value iteration.

This code uses four arrays:
a) nextStateProbability: next state probabilities
b) rewardsTable: table with reward values

The other two arrays we use can be created on-the-fly.
The first one is needed for creating trajectories:
c) possible_actions_per_state
and the second one is used only for "training", in methods such as compute_optimal_action_values:
d) valid_next_states
These two arrays speed up computations but consume RAM memory. Maybe we
will have to test things without them.

This version assumes the rewards are associated to the triple
(s,a,s') (correspond to a Mealy machine),
It also assumes full (not sparse) matrices.

The initial state determined by reset() is random: any possible state.

This implementation is very general in the sense that it represents internally
rewards, actions and states as natural numbers. For instance, if a grid-world
has actions "left", "right", "up", "down", they must be mapped to integers such
as 0, 1, 2 and 3.

The finite MDP class is constructed based on an environment, which is an OpenAI's
gymnasium.Env with spaces.Discrete() for both states (called observations in gym)
and actions.

If the environment wants to have knowledge about the labels associated
to the natural numbers used with/in this MDP class, use
@VerboseKnownDynamicsEnv

@TODO:
 - support Moore (rewards associated to states) instead of only Mealy (rewards associated to transitions) (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiQxeuB56i0)
 - ??? use a single 5-dimension array instead of two matrices (see Example Exercise 3.4 "Give a table analogous to that in Example 3.3)
   To decide about it, I think we can simply check the size of the 2 matrices against one.
 - move code that generates trajectories to a class of agent, given that an environment do not create actions
 - support sparse matrices: e.g. assume the next state probability is sparse or not
 - use objects already available on gym or gymnasium.Env such as env.unwrapped.get_action_meanings()
 - Does the env as an gymnasium.Env have overhead or gets slower?
 - While the class that finds the optimum policy has some support to sparse matrices, this class here does not yet
 - Look at the guidelines to create a gym env:
